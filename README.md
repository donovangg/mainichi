# Mainichi

## About and Inspiration
There's so much good anime that gets released every season nowadays. It's difficult to keep up
when someone has so much going on in real life. When it comes to sit down and finally relax and watch some
anime. You scroll forever with all the new releases! Mainichi is a way to track all the new anime
in the current season. I wanted this to only focus on the current season. Once the current season is finished,
the page gets updated.

## Tech Stack

I bootstrapped this project with the `create-t3-app`. I didn't use everything included with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) but it's easy to get started and get all the goodies like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Built with:<br>

## Features
- List of Current Season Anime thanks to the [JikanAPI](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/)
- Auth taken care of with Firebase.
- Users and Users watchlist is saved in Firestore
- UI with TailwindCSS and Components with [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Would like to do
- User profiles: Since web page is focused on current anime. Having a list of favorites from the past seasons is almost like a sign from when users joined.
