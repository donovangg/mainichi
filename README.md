# Mainichi

## About and Inspiration
Mainichi is a way to find out which anime is airing during the current season.
I personally watch anime seasonally and it's really hard to keep up with all the
different streaming services. With help from the Jikan API, I was able to get the
day of currently airing Anime in Japan.

## Tech Stack

I bootstrapped this project with the `create-t3-app`. I didn't use everything included with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) but it's easy to get started and get all the goodies like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's up next?
